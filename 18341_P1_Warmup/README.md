# Warmup

18-341: Fall Semester of 2022

## Objective and Overview

The purpose of this project is to brush off any dust that has accumulated on
your SystemVerilog skills.  It's as much about getting an FPGA programming
environment set up as anything else.  As such, this project is significantly
simpler than any other course project; and, therefore, worth far fewer points.

This is an **individual** project, to be done in simulation with VCS and on
your Altera DE0-CV board.

## Schedule and Scoring

Project value | 20 points
--- | ---
Project start | 1 Sep 2022
Project due | 7 Sep 2022 at 1:25pm
Drop dead date | 8 Sep 2022 at 1:25pm

If you have not uploaded anything by the drop dead date, we will assume you
are no longer in the course. Why? Because the syllabus says you must *attempt
every project.* Not uploading anything and not showing up to explain what
you’ve done is not attempting the project — see the syllabus for details.

By the way, using your grace day on Project 1 is a very bad idea.

You will have a demonstration of your system in the days soon after the
deadline.  Stay tuned for details on how to sign up for a demo slot.

## A Note about Collaboration

Project 1 is to be accomplished individually.  All work must be your own.

Hints from others can be of great help, both to the hinter and the hintee.
Thus, discussions and hints about the assignment are encouraged.  However, the
project must be coded and written up individually (you may not show, nor view,
any source code from other students).  We may use automated tools to detect
copying.

Use Piazza to ask questions or come visit us during office hours (or email for
an appointment at another time).  We want to see you succeed, but you have to
ask for help.

## Background

Over the semester we’ll do several assignments (homeworks and/or
projects) that are to be implemented and demonstrated on the Altera DE0-CV
boards we’re giving you for the semester.  The kit you’ll receive
contains the board, power supply, some cables, and the StormChaser
daughter board (a peripheral board with lots of I/O).
The basic idea here is to install the development software on
your computer, run it to develop the system described here, and turn
your code in, all before the due date. 

The software is available for Windows and Linux.  Download it at 
http://fpgasoftware.intel.com.  The latest version
of Quartus will work. If you have a Mac (lucky you), you will have to
use a virtual machine (Parallels, VMware, etc).  You can, of course,
just use the computers in the HH-1305 cluster (the “240 lab”) as well. 
(Just don’t try to use them during 240 lab times!)  Windows people will
probably need to do something with the USB Blaster windows driver, which
is available at: http://www.terasic.com.tw/wiki/Altera_USB_Blaster_Driver_Installation_Instructions.

## Assignment Overview

Go to the ECE Receiving Window (HH 1301) between 10 and 5pm
to pick up your Altera DE0-CV kit.  BTW, you’ll be
returning it to the same place at the end of the semester in exchange
for a grade.

Use the invitation link provided on Piazza to access and clone your
GitHub repo.  The repo contains **sumitup.sv,** your starter code.  Also in
the same repo are **tatb.qxp,** a hardware testbench, and **tatb.svp** an
encrypted simulation testbench.  **DE0_CV_Default.qsf** is a pin definition
file for your board.  Write a **p1.sv** file to combine these files,
together with possibly some other SV code and demonstrate the system
running on your board.  Hmm, more information needed.

The basic idea of the **sumitup** thread is to add up a series of numbers
provided at its input.  It is not complex at all.  As described in the
book, the **go_l** signal indicates when the first value is on the input. 
At each **clock** edge another value appears on the input.  However, when
there’s a zero on the **inA** input, that’s the last value and **done** should
immediately be asserted.  The **sumitup** thread is completely and correctly
specified in the **sumitup.sv** file you downloaded.  You will not need to
make any changes to the **sumitup** thread.  Obviously, there must be more
to this project, then.

Your main task is to write a “downstream thread” that captures the
calculated **sum** and holds it for display while the next sum is being
calculated.  All it does is wait for the **done** signal and then loads the
calculated sum into its own register.  The captured value is then
displayed on the lower two hex displays. 

The hardware testbench, which we provide, will generate a set of random
values and send them to your **sumitup** thread (assuming you’ve wired
everything together correctly).  When it’s done, it displays what it
thinks is the 8-bit sum of the series of values in **HEX3** and **HEX2** (the
leftmost digits). Your sum should be displayed in **HEX1** and **HEX0.**  The
idea is that if you’ve interfaced and wired everything together
correctly, then the same two 2-digit hex numbers are shown in the
topmost (left) and bottommost (right) hex displays.  Also, in that case,
the testbench will provide a signal (that you'll hook to **LEDR0**) such
that the LED will light up when the values match.  You’ll need some
combinational logic to drive the displays.  

The testbench header looks like this:

```systemverilog
module tatb // header for our hardware testbench
  (input  logic       ck, done, reset_l, Button0,
   output logic [7:0] valueToinA, // connect this to sumitup's inA
                      tbSum,      // tb's sum for display
   output logic       go_l, 
                      L0,         // L0 indicating sums match
   input  logic [7:0] outResult); // your downstream thread's
                                  // output connected to tb
```

Just to make sure you've thought this through, let me ask a few questions. 
 
* Are you responsible for connecting **tbSum** to anything?  

* Your thread's output value will be connected to **outResult**, as noted in
the comments above.  Should it be connected to anything else?  

* Does the testbench handle the **LEDR0** connection, or do you have to do that?  

If you are unsure about any of these answers, come talk to us before you start hacking away.

## Testbench Operations

We use two of the buttons on the board to control the testbench's
operation.  **BUTTON2** is a reset and will put zeros in the display,
turn **LEDR0** off, and reset the FSM.  **BUTTON0** is used to start the
operation. Reset the board and it should show all zeros in the display. 
When you press and hold **BUTTON0**, the hardware testbench will send a
series of numbers to your **sumitup** thread at the blazing speed of 50
MHz.  You’ll see the sum of what the testbench sent in the upper hex
displays, and the result of what your code calculated in the lower hex
displays (this is the value captured by the downstream thread).  If the
two values are equal, **LEDR0** should light. When you let go of **BUTTON0,**
the hardware testbench will zero its hex displays and your code will
keep displaying the calculated sum in the lower digits.  It will wait
for the next depressing of **BUTTON0** (which will not be depressing because
you’ll then get a whole new sum displayed). When you depress **BUTTON0**
again, a new series of numbers will be sent and displayed. Pushing
**BUTTON2** will reset so that all the displays are zero. Note that the
buttons are active low (they present a logic 0 when pressed).

Why is it called a hardware testbench? Because the testbench is
synthesized into hardware to do the operations mentioned above.  Most of
the testbenches you dealt with in 18-240 were simulation testbenches,
right?  See the difference?

## Some Other Things you Should Learn

There are several details about the devices on your board that I've
given here (buttons are active low, LEDs active high, etc).  Where did I
figure them out?  If you ever want to know about the components on the
DE0-CV board itself, check out the DE0-CV User Manual.  You can find it in PDF
form on the DVD that came in the box (I have also posted a copy on
Canvas).  The manual is a fairly readable document that talks about all
of the components that go into making an FPGA board like the DE0-CV.  I
probably wouldn't read it straight through, but I certainly go to it
often when putting together a project and trying to get the components
to work correctly.  Please take a few minutes to page through it,
particularly the sections dealing with the components for this project: 

* 3.2 Using the LEDs and Switches

* 3.3 Using the 7-segment Displays

Also, the User Manual is one place to go to figure out what to type into
the third page of the Quartus “New Project” wizard when it asks for an
FPGA device type.

## How To Turn In Your Solution

This semester we will be using
[Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/31452665-18-341-fall2019)
to hand-out as well as hand-in project code.  Make sure to commit regularly and
provide informative messages, as this will help TAs immensely to provide
feedback.

When you have finished this project you should tag the release for submission
and push your repo to GitHub.

1. Tag the latest commit as "final"
    ```sh
    $ git tag -a final -m "Final submission for 18341 P1"
    ```

2. Check that the tag was created successfully
    ```sh
    $ git tag
    final
    ```

3. Push repo to GitHub.
    ```sh
    $ git push --tags
    ```

**If you need to alter your submission, remember to delete the tag**

Remotely:
```sh
$ git push --delete final
```

Locally:
```sh
$ git tag -d final
```

## Demos and Late Penalty

We will have demo times outside of class times on or near the due date.  Since
we will demo from the files in your repo, it is possible that you’ll demo on a
following day.

**Define Late:**  Lateness is determined by the file dates of your repo.

**Grace Day:**  You may use your grace day to turn in the solution up to 24
hours late.  If you do not intend to use a grace day (or have already used
yours), make sure you have something in the repo (and have pushed the repo) at
the deadline to avoid getting a zero on this project.
